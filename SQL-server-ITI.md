## attributes 
- simple & composite
- single & multivalued
- stored & derived
- complex (multivalued + composite)
## week entity
- depend on another entity
- represented using double recatngle

![](./images/ternary.jpg)
- the supplier supplies things for that project
- supplies => relation
- entities => supplier, things and project

# SQL SERVER ITI 
## DB life cycle
1. analysis
2. DB design (ERD)
3. DB mapping
4. implementation (using RDMS `relational database management system` like sql server with SQL `structure query language`)
5. application
6. user

## my role with database 
- when creating it i am only database developer
## file based system
- delimited file
- fixed width file

# diffrence between data & meta data
- meta data if the data that descripe data in files 
- meta data like tables names, column names, column datatype,....
- data: the values in these tables

# diffrence between database and database system and database management system
- database: concept
- database management system: software, tool which i build database in, like sql server ot oracle
- database system: tool which i build database in 

# database engine problems
- i must write all my data in the same database engine 
- i can convert my data from sql server to oracel or the opososite
- i can convert database to xml and work on it instead of database engine
# data scientest
- predict that the data will look like in the future

# relationships
- verbs represent relationship between entities
- two entities might have diffrent relations but the must have diffrent meaning
- work == assign they represent onnly one relations ship

# total & partial participation
- one or more, must => mean total participation
- zero or more, may => mean partial participation
- week must have total participation with the relation

# Relationship & Identifying relationship
- relationship:
  - it is represented using diamond
- identifying relationship:
  - it is represented using two diamonds
  - it means that i should define what will be the relation between tables when delete or update (ex: cascade)

# constrain file
- contains all data in the erd put we can't define while maping 
  ex: driven attribute like netsalary=sal+over
  ex: complex attripute like address (street, gov, number of flat)

# mapping
- if partial increase then tables increase
# 1:1 
## 1. total from both sides
- make only one table for both
## 2. partial and total
- make two tables and take primary key from partial and put it in the total
## 3. partial and partial 
- 3 tables make new tables with two primary keys of every table
- either will be the primary key of the new table


# 1:n
- we look at many only
## total
- make 2 tables, we take primary from one and put it in many
## partial 
- make 3 tales, the primary of the new table is the primary of many


# n:m
- always make new table represent the relation
- we make primary key as a composite primary key



# ANSI SQL (American National Standards Institute)
It is a standardized language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
ANSI SQL provides a common syntax and set of rules that relational database management systems (RDBMS) should follow.

Microsoft, Oracle, MySQL, and IBM are all major providers of relational database management systems. 

1. Microsoft: Microsoft offers `SQL Server`, a popular RDBMS. SQL Server supports ANSI SQL and includes additional proprietary extensions and features. Microsoft also provides `Transact-SQL (T-SQL)`, which is a procedural language extension to ANSI SQL used in SQL Server.

2. Oracle: Oracle provides the` Oracle Database`, one of the most widely used enterprise RDBMS. Oracle Database supports ANSI SQL and also includes additional proprietary extensions and features. Oracle has its own variant of SQL called `PL/SQL`, which is a powerful procedural language for developing database applications.

3. MySQL: `MySQL` is an open-source RDBMS widely used for web applications. While MySQL initially had limited support for ANSI SQL, it has `made significant progress in adhering to the ANSI SQL standard`. However, `MySQL also has its own extensions and features that are not part of the standard.`

4. IBM: IBM offers the `DB2 database management system`, which is commonly used in enterprise environments. DB2 supports ANSI SQL and provides additional features and extensions. IBM also has its own variant of SQL called `SQL PL`, which is a procedural language for developing stored procedures and functions within DB2.

# transact sql 
1. DDL: data defining language 
   - meta data & structure
   - create table
   - create view
   - create function
   - alter 
   - drop
   - select into
2. DML: data manipulation language
   - data
   - insert
   - update
   - delete
   - merge 
3. DDCL: data control language
   - security & permations
   - grant
   - deny
   - revoke
4. DQL: data query language
   - display
   - select
5. TCL: transaction control language
   - excution

   - commit
   - rollback


# sql quiries
# DDL (data defining language| meta data)
## create table 
```sql
create table emp
(
   eid int primary key,
   ename varchar(20) not null,
   eage int,
   eadd varchar(20) default 'cairo',
   hiredate date default getdate(),
   Dnum int
);
```
## make changes to only one column in db
- use command `alter`
- it is used to add column, drop column, change datatype (but must be of same category) of column,....
```sql
alter table emp add sal int
```
## delete table
```sql
drop table emp;
```

# DML (insert, update, delete)
## insert 
- you know
## insert constructor
```sql
insert into emp(ename,eid)
values('eman',8),('sandy',10),('nour',7)
```

# Types of join
## cross join
- cartisan product
- find all possible relations between tables, that tables doesn't have real relationship, there is no foreign id matches
```sql
Select sname, dname 
from student, department
```
## inner join
- equal join
- find matches rows using foreign key
```sql
select sname, dname 
from student, department 
where department.did=student.did
```
## outer join
1. left join
- give me all data in the left column if there is relation it say else give me null
```sql
select sname, dname 
from student left outer join department 
on department.did=student.did
```
2. right join
- give me all data in the right column if there is relation it say else give me null
```sql
select sname, dname 
from student right outer join department 
on department.did=student.did
```
4. full outer join
- i ask him to give me all data in all tables even if there is a relation or not
```sql
select sname, dname 
from student full outer join department 
on department.did=student.did
```
5. self join
- i suppose that table in database is the child table which contains foreign id, and i make another table that represent parent 

```sql
select x.ename as empName, y.ename as superName
from Employee x, Emplouee y
where y.eid=x.superid 
```

# coalesce
- i said to him to show any value here from the columns i enter
```sql
select coalesce(st_fname,st_lname_st_address,'no data') 
from student
```
- i said show fname if exist, if not show lname, if not show address, if not show 'no data'

# is null
- it takes two parameters it put second value in the place of the first in case of null values
```sql
select isnull(st_name,'has no name') as newName
from student
```

# concat 
- change all in it into strings 
- remove null and put empty string in place of it 

```sql
select concat(st_fname,'',st_age)
from student
```

# ragex
```sql
'a%h' -- start with a end with h
'%a_' -- the char before the last is a 
'ahm%' -- start with ahm
'[ahm]%' -- start with a, h or m 
'[^ahm]%' -- start with any char rather than a, h nor m
'[a-h]%' -- start with char in range from a to h 
'[^a-h]%' -- start with char not in range from a to h 
'%[%]' -- string end with %
'%[_]%' -- it contains undersqure
```
# aggregate functions
- count, min, max, avg, sum

```sql
SELECT Min(salary), did from employee
```
- that query will give me error, i can not return value and column so the group is found
- when i wnat to use aggregate function with columns i must use group by 

```sql
SELECT Min(salary), did from employee group by did
```
![](./images/groupBy.jpg)
```sql
select count(eid), address from employee group by address
```
- that will count nunber of employess in same address

```sql
select count(eid), address 4
from employee 1
where did in (10,30) 2
group by address 3
```
- it will execute the quiries in that order:
   1. from employee
   2. where did in (10,30)
   3. group by address
   4. select count(eid), address

# why using where with aggregate is false and we should use having?
- where is excuted in every row individual but aggregate is excuting on set of rows, so we use having with aggregate and group

```sql
select sum(salary), did
from employee 
group by did
having Sum(salary)>22000 
```
# where & having
- where: works with rows 
- having: works with groups

# Notice that problem and the way to solve it ......
```sql
-- 1
select avg(st_age) 
from student
```
```sql
-- 2
select sum(st_age)/count(*)
from student
```
- these two quiries will give me two diffrent answers becasuse there is age with null value, but which is correct? 
- in fact the second quiry is the correct one
- what should i do to the first one to be true?
- you should add isnull(st_age,0) to that quiry so if there was any null value it will be zero

```sql
-- 3
select avg(isnull(st_age,0)) 
from student
```
- now which is faster the third one is faster because second one uses two aggregate functions 

# notice that wrong quirey and the correct of it 
```sql
select * 
from students 
where st_age < avg(st_age) 
-- it will give you error because you can not use where with aggregate
```
- so the subquiries come to make subquirey instead of using aggregate with where
```sql
select * 
from students 
where st_age < (select avg(st_age) from student)
``` 

# if he ask me to give all name of departments with students
```sql
select distinct sept_name
from department
where dept_id in 
(select distinct(dept_id)
 from students 
 where dept_id is not null
)
```
- but we can also use inner join here instead of subquery
- now which is better?
  - the last thing you think about is subqueries because it took to match time 
  - engine before doing any subquery, try to make it using joins
  - so you add load to engine with no need 

```sql
select distinct dept_name 
from department d
inner join student s
on d.dept_id=s.dept_id
```
- may be in some times using subqueries is better 
  - if i use one subquery to take place of 3 or more joins it may be better
  - you must think about time of each before choosing the one to excute

# union family
- union: select distincit
- union all: select all
- intersect: find similar between two result sets
- except: find which in first and not in second

# EERD (erd + inheritance)
![](./images/eerd.jpg)
![](./images/eerd2.jpg)
## generalization & specification
![](./images/eerd3.jpg)

# diffrence between disjoin & overlap
- disjoin: mean that it have only one relation 
- overlap: can take more than one





# Advanced databases
![](./images/adv.jpg)
## instance
- collection of services and applications 

## diffrent servers in same machine
- i can install diffrent servers in my machine
- the first one in default and take pc name
- how to connect with other servers?

![](./images/instances.jpg)
- .\cairo and add \ for all

## authorization & authentication 
   ## authentication 
   - password and user that i enter to connect server
   - i can connect to database using excel, sql server management system is only a tool 

# top
- i can select database to give me the highest 3 in db

```sql
select distinct top(3) salary 
from table salaries 
order by salary desc
```
# newid
- global universal id --GUID
- id is unique overal server 

# excution order
- from 
- join 
- on 
- where
- grouping
- having 
- select [aggragate, distinct, as]
- order by
- top

# full path
## db objects [table view function sp]
- to access any object from db: [serverName].[DBName].[schemaName].[objectName]

```sql
select * from [DESKTOP-VF50P25].iti.dbo.Student
```
- if you are using same database and you want to access table in that db [DBName].[schemaName].[objectName]

```sql
select * from Company_SD.dbo.Project
```

# conclusion
- you can make query in diffrent two servers or deffrent two databases using full path 

## select * into
- it creates new table using another table

```sql
select * into table2 
from table1
```
```sql
select * into company_sd.bdo.table1 
from table1
```

## insert based on select
- that two tables are created and have the same structure 
- that will insert only data
```sql
insert into tab3
select * from student 
```

# Ranking functions

- Rank()

![](./images/rankingFunctions3.jpg)
![](./images/rankingFunctions2.jpg)

# we can not use alias in where because select is excuted after where
- to solve that problem we use subquiries 

```sql
select * from (
   select *,Row_number() over(order by st_age desc) as RN 
   from student
) as newTable
where RN=1
```

## char 
- char [fixed lenght chars]
- varchar [variable length chars]
- nchar [unicode] detect which language i enter (accept all language not only english)
- nvarchar
- nvarchar(max) accept up to 2GB

## dateTime
- date MM/DD/yyyy
- Time hh:mm
- time(7) 7: represent accurecy
- smalldatetime
- datetime
- datetime2(7)
- datetimeoffset date+time+time-zone

## binary
- binary
- image

## others
- xml
- unique identifier
- sql_variant

## case
- we may use it also with updates
```sql
select ins_name,case 
when salary>=3000 then 'high'
when salary< 3000 then 'low'
else 'no value'
end as new_salary
from instrunctor 
```

# iif function
- it will be given with condition and two cases if true and if false

```sql
select ins_name,iif(salary>3000,'high','low') from instructor
```
# convert & cast & format
- give it date and it will give you format of date as a string
```sql
select convert(varchar(20),getdate())

select cast(getdate() as varchar(20))

select format(getdate(),'dd-MM-yyyy')
```

## eomonth 
- end of month 
- return last day in month i give it






# Lec 6
# DB
![](./images/db.jpg)
## physical representation
- physical files
  - ldf: transactions
  - mdf: tables
## logical representations 
- file group
  - primary file group: by default primary file group pointer to mdf 
  - for best performance i will make another file groups which will point to files that contain data instead of primary

# Hard disk and reading data
- hard disk read data sequantial not paraller

# joins & hard disks & files
- if i have two tables i will make join between them i should but each table in diffrent file in diffrent hard disks
- two hard disks now will read in paraller, so the engine will work more faster

# driven attribute in sql server
- it will be written in db as eqn
- there will be bool value with true or false `is pressed` it will take yes or no

# delete and update relations 
## cascade
- if you delete or update parent make the same to child
- it works with week entity
## no action
- default
## set null
- if i can delete department with employees as an example
## set default
- will but default value if i delete

# schema
- i can make diffrent schemas to but tables in it

## importance of schema
1. i can give access to user to use this schema, rather than give permession for every table in that schema
2. i can make many objects (tables, views, ...) wth same name but in diffrent schemas 
3. if i have many tables in db i can but all which connected to same category under same schema so i can reach them more easily

## move table to schema
```sql
alter schema hr transfer Student
```

# synonym
```sql
create synonym HE
for HumanResources.EmplyeeDepartmentHistory
```

# diffrence between drop & delete & truncate
- drop -- delete data & meta data
- delete -- delete data, doesn't return to first id
- truncate -- delete data, return to first id
- - truncate is faster that delete, beacuse delete is written in log file

# constrains
- specify rules for data in tables
- new constrains must match all data in db, Regarding rules which will be applied for new data only
## common constrains with sql
- `not null`
- `unique`
- `primary_key`
- `foreign key`
- `check`
- `default`
- `create index`

## create constraint
```sql
alter table person
add constraint UC_person unique(id, lastname)
```
```sql
alter table person 
add constraint chk_age check (age>10)
```

## drop constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Person;
```

# Rule
- defined at the database level and can be applied to specific columns. 
- Each database can have multiple rules, but each table or column can have only one rule associated with it.
- we can make rules to apply some conditions to databse only on new data i add

```sql
create rule r1 as @x>1000

-- add rule to column salary
sp_bindrule r1, 'instructor.salary'

-- remove rule from column salary
sp_unbindrule 'instructor.salary'

-- remove rule form db
drop rule r1
```

# user_defined datatype
- allow you to create custom data types based on the existing built-in types

```sql
-- Define a user-defined data type for ISBN
CREATE TYPE ISBNType AS CHAR(13);

-- Create a table to store books with an ISBN column of the custom data type
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255),
    Author VARCHAR(100),
    ISBN ISBNType
);

-- Insert a book record using the custom data type
INSERT INTO Books (BookID, Title, Author, ISBN)
VALUES (1, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', '978-0061120084');

-- Query the books table
SELECT * FROM Books;

-- to drop type
drop type ISBN
```

# user & permissions

**Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**

1. **Create a New User:**
   1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   2. In the Object Explorer, expand your server, expand the "Security" node, right-click on "Users," and choose "New User..."
   3. Follow the wizard to create a new user. Specify the user name and the login name for the user.

2. **Assign Permissions:**
   1. After creating the user, expand your database in the Object Explorer, navigate to the "Security" folder, and then the "Users" folder.
   2. Right-click on the user you created and choose "Properties."
   3. In the "User Mapping" section, you can assign roles (e.g., db_datareader, db_datawriter) or specific permissions to the user.


# variables
## locar variable 
```sql
Declare @x int

-- set value
set @x=10
select @x=100
select @x=age from student where id=1 
update student set fname='omar', @x=age where id=9
declare @x int=100
```
## global variable
- can't decalare
- can't assign
```sql
select @@servername
-- return server name

select @@rowcount
-- return number of rows affected by the last query i did

select @@version
-- return sql server version 

select @@error
-- error for last query

select @@identity
-- last identity of last insert
```

# batch
- it refers to a set of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a group. 

```sql
declare @x int
set @x=10
select @x
-- these 3 statments must be excuted with each others
```

# table in memory & return array in sql
```sql
declare @t table (x int) -- that table is declared in memory, after the excute of that query it will be deleted automatically
insert into @t 
select st_id from student 
select * from @t
-- that will return array of st_id

declare @t table (x int, y varchar(20))
insert into @t 
select st_id, st_fname from student 
select * from @t
-- that will return 2D array of st_id and st_fname
```
# dynamic query (excute)
- that will take string 
- change it to sql query
- run it

```sql
excute('select * from studnet')
```
- it will be nice if i use variable inside string and make concatinate to write query

```sql
declare @col varchar(20)='*',@tab varchar(20)='student'
excute('select '+@col+'from '+@tab)
```
# control of flow statments
## if 
```sql
declare @x int
update student 
set st_age+=1
select @x=@@ROWCOUNT
if(@x>0)
   select 'multi rows affected'
else 
   select 'no rows affected' 
```
## begin....end
- they replace {...}

```sql
if(@x>0)
   begin
   select 'multi rows affected'
   end
```
## if exists & if not exists
```sql
if exists(select name from sys.tables where name='student')
   select 'table exists'
else
   create table student(
      ID int
      name varchar(20)
   )
```
```sql
if not exists(select dept_id from student where dept_id=20)
and not exists(select dept_id from instructor where dept_id=20)
   delete from department where dept_id=20
else
   select 'that department has no relations'
```
## try & catch
- the above examble may be done using try and catch
```sql
begin try
   delete from department where dept_id=20
end try
begin catch
   select 'error'
   select ERROR_LINE(), ERROR_NUMBER(), ERROR_MESSAGE()
   -- that will tell me more information about the error so i will fix it 
end catch
```
## while 
```sql
declare @x int=10
while @x<=20
begin
   set @x+=1
   if(@x<=14)
      continue
   else 
      break
   select @x
end
```
# diffrence between batch & transaction & script
## batch
- set of queries, doesn't have relation with each other but they are excuted at the same time
- every query is excuted lonly, every query return message 

## script
- set of statments seperated from each other with go
- set of quiries doesn't related with each other but are separe from each other with go
- we use it with quiries that con't be excuted in the same batch

```sql
create table
go -- we add that go because it will gives me error if i try to excute both at the same time
drop table

create rule
go
sp_bindrule
```

## transaction
- set of queries 
- single unit of work
- all will be excuted or none excute

### what are mdf and ldf files?
In the context of Microsoft SQL Server, MDF and LDF are file extensions associated with the primary data file and the transaction log file, respectively.

1. **MDF (Master Data File):**
   - The MDF file, also known as the primary data file, is the main database file where the actual data is stored. It contains tables, indexes, stored procedures, and other database objects.
   - The MDF file has a .mdf extension and is crucial for the functioning of the database.

2. **LDF (Log Data File):**
   - The LDF file, also known as the transaction log file, is responsible for holding a record of all transactions and database modifications made to the database.
   - The LDF file has a .ldf extension and is critical for ensuring the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of database transactions.

Here's a brief overview of their roles:

- **MDF (Primary Data File):**
  - Stores the actual data and database objects.
  - It is the file that you typically backup to preserve the database.
  - The MDF file is essential for the recovery of data in case of a database failure.

- **LDF (Transaction Log File):**
  - Records all transactions and modifications to the database.
  - Allows for database recovery to a specific point in time.
  - Facilitates transaction rollback and undo operations.
  - Helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the database.

In a typical SQL Server database setup, you'll have at least one MDF file and one LDF file associated with each database. Additionally, you can have multiple secondary data files (NDF files) for user-defined filegroups.

It's worth noting that while the MDF and LDF files are crucial components of a SQL Server database, managing them effectively, including proper backup and maintenance strategies, is essential for ensuring the overall health and performance of the database system.

### return to transactions
*explicit transaction*
- in it i must tell the engine where is the begin of my transaction by using begin, and where is the end by using commit (success) or rollback (failier)
- put your transaction quiries between try and catch
- there is only one case sql will rollback automatically, if the server restart during excuting my transaction

```sql
begin try 
   begin transaction 
      insert into child values(1)
      insert into child values(2)
      insert into child values(3)
   commit
end try
begin catch
   rollback
end catch
```
# functions in sql
## 1. builtin functions
- they are scalar funcitons
- scalar function: mean function return only one value
## 2. user-defined functions 

![](./images/fun.jpg)

# diffrence between collesce & isnull
- collesce: same as isnull but take more than two values

# user defined function 
## scalar function
```sql
create function getsname(@id int)
returns varchar(20)
   begin
      declare @name varchar(20)
      select @name=st_fname from student where st_id=@id
      return @name
   end

-- to call it 
select dbo.getsname(1)
```
## inline table function 
```sql
create function getins(@did int)
returns table 
as 
return (
   select ins_name, salary*12 as total_salary
   from Instructor
   where dept_id=@did
)

-- to call it
select * from getins(1) -- because it will return table
```
## multistatment table valued function
```sql
create function getstuds(@format varchar(20))
returns @t table  
            (
               id int,
               ename varchar(20)
            )
as 
   begin 
      if @format = 'first'
         insert into @t
         select st_id, st_fname from student
      else if @format = 'last'
         insert into @t
         select st_id, st_lname from student
      else if @format = 'full'
         insert into @t
         select st_id, st_fname+' '+st_lname from student
      return 
   end

-- to call it
select * from getins('full')
```

# windowing functions
## lead
## lag
## first_value
- find first value in the result of that query
## last_value
- find last value in the result of that query

```sql
select sname, grade,
   x=lag(sname) over(partition by cname order by grade), -- x= name of person before me in grade
   y=lead(sname) over(partition by cname order by grade) -- y= name of person after me in grade
from grades
```
```sql 
select * from(
select sname, grade,
   x=lag(sname) over(order by grade), 
   y=lead(sname) over(order by grade) 
from grades
) as new tables
where sname='eman'
```
- if i remove sub query and write that 
```sql
select sname, grade,
   x=lag(sname) over(order by grade), 
   y=lead(sname) over(order by grade) 
from grades
where sname='eman
```
- where will be applied to thatquery before select and then he will not see any data to put in lag and lead so they return null, where is excuted before select



# index
- table has pk, sorted, clustered index
- it is better to search for specific record using primary key, because primary key have some thing called clustered index which make me access specific record more quickly
- that index and trees are stored in memory
- pages are stored in hard disk

## non clustered index
- index made by me for columns that i search with frequently
- to create non clustered

```sql
create nonclustered index myindex
on student(st_name) 
```


## clusterd index
- is created by default for primary column, if i have no primary key i will create it for any other column
- if i give clustered for any other table it will not be created for primary column

## unique columns & index
- non clustered index is created by default for unique columns

- if i want to create constrained and index for specific column

```sql
create unique index i4 
on student(st_age)
```

# system databases in SQL server
## master database
- contains meta data of the server

## model database
- any new database created take copy from it 

## msdb
- contain jobs

## tempdb
- contains temp database
- data in it will be stored for a period of time and then deleted 
- i need it while excuting some quiries, i like sub query

### local tables, session bassed tables
- temporiry tables i create in tempdb for a period of time
- it is stored in temb db, it is name must start with `#`
- it is created for only that query (that session 'session bassed')

```sql
create table #exam(
   eid int,
   edate date,
   numofQ int
)
```

### global table, shared table
- stored in tempdb
- it is shared for all users of that db 
- name must start with `##`
- it will be destroied when all people whom were connected during the creation log out 

```sql
create table ##exam(
   eid int,
   edate date,
   numofQ int
)
```

## table variable
- global for the batch only

```sql
declare @t table(x int)

# diffrence between rollup and cube
Both ROLLUP and CUBE are extensions to the GROUP BY clause in SQL that allow you to generate subtotals and grand totals in result sets. However, they have some differences in how they produce these totals.

## ROLLUP:

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
FROM table
GROUP BY ROLLUP (column1, column2, ...);
```

### Behavior:
- ROLLUP generates subtotals and a grand total for the specified columns.
- It applies the same aggregate function to each level of the hierarchy, adding a new record for each level.
- In your example query:
  ```sql
  SELECT productId as x, SUM(quantities) as Quantities
  FROM sales 
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(productId);
  ```
  This will produce subtotals for each `productId` and a grand total with the sum of all quantities.

## CUBE:

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
FROM table
GROUP BY CUBE (column1, column2, ...);
```

### Behavior:
- CUBE, like ROLLUP, generates subtotals and grand totals, but it does so for all possible combinations of the specified columns.
- It produces a result set that includes subtotals for each individual column, all combinations of two columns, all combinations of three columns, and so on.
- In your case, if you use CUBE:
  ```sql
  SELECT productId as x, SUM(quantities) as Quantities
  FROM sales 
  GROUP BY CUBE(productId);
  ```
  This will produce subtotals for each `productId`, subtotals for all possible combinations of two `productId`s, and a grand total with the sum of all quantities.

## Summary:
- ROLLUP is more focused on generating subtotals and a grand total along a specified hierarchy.
- CUBE, on the other hand, generates subtotals and grand totals for all possible combinations of the specified columns, providing a more comprehensive view of the data.

## grouping sets
`GROUPING SETS` is another extension to the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL, allowing you to specify multiple groupings in a single query. It provides more flexibility than `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` by allowing you to explicitly define the groups you want to include in the result set.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
FROM table
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((column1, column2, ...), (column1, ...), ());
```

### Behavior:
- `GROUPING SETS` allows you to specify a list of groupings, and for each grouping, it produces subtotals or totals.
- The empty set `()` represents the grand total.
- Unlike `CUBE`, where all possible combinations are considered, `GROUPING SETS` lets you explicitly define the combinations you are interested in.
- In the syntax above, each grouping is specified within a set of parentheses.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT productId as x, country, SUM(quantities) as Quantities
FROM sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((productId, country), ());
```
In this example, the query will produce subtotals for each combination of `productId` and `country`, as well as a grand total with the sum of all quantities.

### Summary:
- `GROUPING SETS` provides more control and customization compared to `ROLLUP` and `CUBE`.
- It allows you to explicitly specify the groupings you want in the result set, making it more flexible for complex reporting requirements.
- The empty set `()` is often used to represent the grand total.

# pivot
Your provided SQL query is using the PIVOT operator in SQL Server. PIVOT is used to rotate rows into columns, and it's commonly used for cross-tabulation queries where you want to transform rows of data into columns.

In your specific example, it looks like you are trying to pivot the `Quantity` values based on the `salesman` values ([Ahmed], [Khalid], [Ali]). Here's a breakdown of your query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales
PIVOT (
    SUM(Quantity) 
    FOR salesman IN ([Ahmed], [Khalid], [Ali])
) AS pvt;
```

Explanation:

- **SELECT *:** Retrieves all columns from the `sales` table.

- **PIVOT:** The PIVOT clause starts here. It specifies that you want to pivot the data.

- **SUM(Quantity):** The aggregation function applied to the values you are pivoting. In this case, it's the sum of the `Quantity`.

- **FOR salesman IN ([Ahmed], [Khalid], [Ali]):** Specifies the values of the `salesman` column that you want to pivot into separate columns ([Ahmed], [Khalid], [Ali]).

- **AS pvt:** Assigns an alias (`pvt`) to the result set.

This query transforms rows with different salesman values into columns with the corresponding summed quantities. The resulting columns will be named [Ahmed], [Khalid], and [Ali].

Just note that for PIVOT to work, your source data needs to have a well-defined set of values for the column you are pivoting. In this case, the `salesman` column should have values [Ahmed], [Khalid], and [Ali]. If there are additional or different values, you might need to adjust your query accordingly.
